The purpose of this document is to allow users to more efficiently track and understand changes made to the caen2018 acquisition software.


Version 1.0.0 - Start of the release notes. Base version of caen2018 frontend

Version 1.0.1 - Added frontend code version to the ODB

Version 2.0.0 - Changed the Diagnostics from eventid 2 to eventid 8 as to not interfere with the VME scalers

Version 2.1.0 - Added return value output for all CAEN related errors. Added check of ndigitizers against MAXNB at initialization.  Changed the interpret functions (connection type and acqusition mode) to explicitly check the ODB setting against all possible options instead of defaulting to one if one or more of the others were not found. 

Version 2.1.1 - Changed frontend name to from "caen2018 VX1730 Frontend" to "caen2018_dpp_frontend".

Version 2.1.2 - Added the CAEN version outputs to the makefile to give _compile hidden files with the information. 

Version 2.1.3 - Changed the hardcoded eventid for digitizer and diagnositcs to pull from eventid.h.  EventID remains 1 and 8 for digitizer and diagnostics respectively.

Version 3.0.0 - Started to make the multi-module type compatibility version.  Started adding the x740 module with DPP-QDC firmware.  Board information and general board registers should work fine. Changed experim.h such that settings below "general_board registers" are module type specific.  This way things are organized by type of module followed by the firmware specific settings for each respective module type.  Need to finish the channel and group settings for the x740 stuff. Also need to think harder about the diagnostics client.  The same diagnostics are not all present for the different module types.  There will be much work ahead to test all of this...

Version 3.0.1 - Added Register 0x1n2C to the diagnostics following email correspondance with Carlo.
